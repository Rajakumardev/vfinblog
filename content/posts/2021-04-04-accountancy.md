What is Accountancy?
	It is a common question that arises to all those who hear it newly or those who have inspired to learn it. Generally, we never separate the word "Accountancy" from our routine life. Really directly or indirectly we are using accountancy many times if you are going to join as a student in a university/schools. You are supposed to pay a fee to your school or university here your university/ school makes a "collection" of your fees amount either through online payment or cash payment..then your University/ school make use of "records" their collections made from you. After that, they will make a sheet by "classifying" the amount of your fee as those who pay through a bank or through online banking as "bank account" and those who paid through cash as " Cash account". And then finally your University/ school make a Final sheet which is prepared to "present" the actual fees amount received and not yet received from you to the organizers of your university or schools...Hence we use accountancy in our regular day-to-day life.
Meaning of Accountancy:
	Accountancy is the collection, recording, classification, and presentation of financial data for the benefit of management, outsiders of the company.

Outsiders of the company:
	Any person or organization or banks who have interest in that company or those who provide loans to that company for its development are known as outsiders of the company.
